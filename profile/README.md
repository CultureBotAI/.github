## About Us

CultureBotAI is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and develops AI-powered solutions for microbial research, cultivation, and analysis. We create intelligent tools that enhance laboratory workflows, optimize culture conditions, and accelerate microbiological discoveries.

Our primary focus includes:
- **Cultivation of isolated and novel organisms**
- **Culture optimization** through data-driven approaches
- **Growth preference prediction** using machine learning and AI methods

## Our Mission

**The mission of CultureBotAI is to revolutionize microbial research through:**
- AI-driven automation of cultivation processes
- Real-time monitoring and optimization of culture conditions
- Integration of diverse microbial data through knowledge graphs
- Predictive modeling for growth preferences and culture success

## Key Resources

### üß¨ [kg-microbe](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe) 
The comprehensive knowledge graph that powers CultureBotAI. This resource integrates diverse microbial data to enable AI-driven insights.

### üìã [METPO Ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/METPO) | [GitHub](https://github.com/microbiomedata/METPO)
The Microbial Ecology and Taxonomy Phenotypic Ontology (METPO) provides standardized terms that help organize the kg-microbe knowledge graph and power text extraction from scientific literature.
