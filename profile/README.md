# CultureBotAI ðŸ¦ 

Welcome to CultureBotAI - where artificial intelligence meets microbial cultivation.

**Principal Investigator:** Dr. Marcin P. Joachimiak  
**Laboratory:** Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

## About Us

CultureBotAI develops AI-powered solutions for microbial research, cultivation, and analysis. We create intelligent tools that enhance laboratory workflows, optimize culture conditions, and accelerate microbiological discoveries.

Our primary focus includes:
- **Cultivation of isolated and novel organisms**
- **Culture optimization** through data-driven approaches
- **Growth preference prediction** using machine learning and AI methods

## Our Mission

To revolutionize microbial research through AI-driven automation, monitoring, and optimization of culturing processes.
