## About Us

CultureBotAI develops AI-powered solutions for microbial research, cultivation, and analysis. We create intelligent tools that enhance laboratory workflows, optimize culture conditions, and accelerate microbiological discoveries.

Our primary focus includes:
- **Cultivation of isolated and novel organisms**
- **Culture optimization** through data-driven approaches
- **Growth preference prediction** using machine learning and AI methods

## Our Mission

To revolutionize microbial research through AI-driven automation, monitoring, and optimization of culturing processes.

## Key Resources

### üß¨ [kg-microbe](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-microbe) 
The comprehensive knowledge graph that powers CultureBotAI. This resource integrates diverse microbial data to enable AI-driven insights.

### üìã [METPO Ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/METPO) | [GitHub](https://github.com/microbiomedata/METPO)
The Microbial Ecology and Taxonomy Phenotypic Ontology (METPO) provides standardized terms that help organize the kg-microbe knowledge graph and power text extraction from scientific literature.

### üìÑ [kg-microbe Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639989v1)
Read our bioRxiv preprint detailing the development and applications of the kg-microbe knowledge graph.

## Projects

Our repositories contain various AI-powered tools and frameworks designed to:
- Automate microbial culture monitoring and analysis
